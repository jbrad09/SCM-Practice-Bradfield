## What is SCM?
SCM (Source Control Management) is a system that tracks and manages changes to software code, documents, and other digital assets over time. It allows teams to:
- **Collaborate Efficiently:** Multiple contributors can work on the same project simultaneously.
- **Track Changes:** Every modification is recorded, making it possible to review history and understand the evolution of the project.
- **Revert to Previous Versions:** If issues arise, previous versions of the project can be restored.

## How GitHub Helps with SCM
GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git, a popular distributed version control system. It enhances SCM by providing:
- **Centralized Repository Hosting:** Easily store and manage code in a single place.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Integrated features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking streamline teamwork.
- **Branch Management:** Efficiently create and manage branches to experiment and develop features independently.
- **Community and Open Source:** Facilitate sharing and contribution to projects on a global scale.

GitHub simplifies the process of source control management, making it easier for developers to collaborate, track changes, and maintain high-quality code.
